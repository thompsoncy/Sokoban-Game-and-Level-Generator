This is the source code for a C++ project for my CS 3520 - Programming in C++ class taken in Spring 2018. 

This project was the model side of a game of Sokoban. Each level in this game is procedurally generated. This model was then extended by others separately and attached to a controller and view.

This project is currently playable as is. Simply run main.cpp. Since this is the model the graphics are just text. You move the player with a standard wasd layout. p is player, w is wall, e is empty, b is box, g is goal, y is a player standing on a goal and z is a box on a goal. Once all boxes are on a goal you win.
